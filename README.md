## About myself

I'm now a postgraduate student in Tsinghua University, Beijing,China and major in keyword search (KWS) and sometimes I'd like to do something about automatic speech recognition.

I like mathematics and have a deep interest in the theory of deep learning and the mathematic explanation of it, which perhaps will be my major research field in the future.

As a Chinese, my English is not good enough, and also, there may be some mistakes in my articles. So please contact me through Email zeyuhongwu1995@gmail.com
