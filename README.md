## About Myself

I'm now a postgraduate student in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China and major in keyword search (KWS) and sometimes I'd like to do something about automatic speech recognition (ASR).

I like math and have a deep interest in the theory of deep learning and the mathematic explanation of it, which perhaps will be my major research field in the future.

As a Chinese, I know my English is not good enough, and also, there may be some mistakes in my articles. So if you have some advice for me, whether language mistakes or other problems, please just let me know through my Email - zeyuhongwu1995@gmail.com. Thanks!
