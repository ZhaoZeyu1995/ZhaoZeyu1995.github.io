## About Myself

I'm now a PhD student in the Centre for Speech Technology Research, School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland. 
I major in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially End-to-End ASR.

I am Chinese so I know my English is not good enough, and also, there may be some mistakes in my articles. 
So if you have any advice for me, whether language mistakes or other, please let me know through my Email - zeyuhongwu1995@gmail.com. 
Cheers mate!
